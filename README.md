<h1>AC262,536 vs S23 – Which SARM Gave Me Better Results?</h1>

<p>I’ve tested <strong>AC262,536</strong> and <strong>S23</strong> in different phases of my training. One is known for being mild and clean, the other is more hardcore and comes with a heavier punch (and some side effects).</p>

<p>In this article, I’ll walk you through my real-world experience running both of them. I’ll cover muscle growth, strength, side effects, suppression, and who each SARM is best for.</p>

<p>As always, I’ve included the exact sources I used—no guessing, no sketchy sellers.</p>

<h2>AC262,536 – What It Did For Me</h2>

<p><strong>AC262,536</strong> (also called Accadrine) is a <strong>selective androgen receptor modulator</strong> that’s often compared to Ostarine or LGD-3303. It’s designed to give <strong>mild anabolic effects</strong> without the harsh suppression or liver stress.</p>

<p>I used it during a recomp phase at <strong>20mg/day for 8 weeks</strong>. Here’s what I noticed:</p>

<h3>My Results:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Improved muscle tone and vascularity</li>
  <li>Steady strength gains in upper body lifts</li>
  <li>Zero mood swings or aggression</li>
  <li>No bloating or water retention</li>
  <li>Sleep and libido stayed normal</li>
</ul>

<p>AC262 felt smooth. I’d describe it as a "performance enhancer" that quietly boosts your training without disrupting your body’s balance. No shutdown, no headaches, and I didn’t even need a PCT.</p>

<p><strong>✅ Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Great for cutting or recomp</li>
  <li>No suppression at moderate doses</li>
  <li>No liver toxicity or estrogen issues</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>❌ Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Not strong enough for hardcore bulking</li>
  <li>Results come slower than stronger SARMs</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Best For:</strong> Beginners, Cutting, Recomp</p>

<h2>S23 – The Hardest Hitting SARM I’ve Used</h2>

<p><strong>S23</strong> is probably the strongest SARM I’ve run solo. It’s often called the “SARM version of Winstrol” because it gives <strong>hard, dry muscle gains</strong> with extreme vascularity. It also comes with the most suppression I’ve seen from a SARM.</p>

<p>I ran S23 at <strong>10mg/day for 6 weeks</strong> during a short cut. It made a huge impact—fast.</p>

<h3>My Results:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Insane definition after Week 2</li>
  <li>Pumps that felt almost painful</li>
  <li>Strength gains in low-rep compound lifts</li>
  <li>Visible fat loss without much cardio</li>
  <li>Noticed testicular shrinkage by Week 5</li>
</ul>

<p>Make no mistake—S23 is not for beginners. Suppression was real, and I needed a full PCT with Nolva. Libido dropped during week 6, and sleep was rough a few nights. Still, the physique it gave me was next-level.</p>

<p><strong>✅ Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Massive strength and vascularity</li>
  <li>Insane fat loss and muscle hardness</li>
  <li>Fast results—noticeable by Week 2</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>❌ Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Heavy suppression (you’ll need a PCT)</li>
  <li>Libido drop near end of cycle</li>
  <li>Can make you feel a bit edgy</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Best For:</strong> Cutting, Advanced Users, Body Recomp</p>

<p>If you’re new to SARMs, AC262,536 is way safer and easier to manage. But if you’ve run cycles before and want maximum definition and strength fast—S23 delivers, just be ready for the sides.</p>

<h2>How I Test My SARMs</h2>

<p>I don’t just guess with these. I follow a strict method:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use SARMs solo (no stacks unless testing combos)</li>
  <li>Track progress with body scans, weights, and daily journal</li>
  <li>Bloodwork before and after every cycle</li>
  <li>Same calories and training plan each time</li>
</ul>

<p>This gives me real, unbiased data—not bro-science or placebo. I recommend you do the same if you're serious about results and health.</p>

<h2>FAQs – AC262,536 vs S23</h2>

<h3>Is AC262,536 suppressive?</h3>
<p>Not at the doses I used (under 30mg/day). No shutdown symptoms. Still, always monitor with bloodwork.</p>

<h3>Is S23 legal?</h3>
<p>Technically, it’s legal to buy for research purposes. It’s not approved for human use, so always buy from a reputable source.</p>

<h3>Can you stack AC262 and S23?</h3>
<p>You could, but I don’t recommend it. S23 is strong on its own, and stacking increases side effects and suppression.</p>

<h3>What’s better for cutting fat?</h3>
<p>S23. It burns fat while keeping you strong and dry. But AC262 is safer if you're just starting out.</p>

<h3>Do you need PCT after AC262?</h3>
<p>Usually no. Most users don’t report suppression at typical doses. But always check your labs to be safe.</p>

<h2>Final Verdict</h2>

<p><strong>AC262,536</strong> is my top pick for cutting or recomposition if you want <strong>steady, clean results</strong> with no real side effects. <strong>S23</strong> is a beast if you’re already experienced and want <strong>hard, fast physique changes</strong>—just know it comes at a price (suppression, PCT, etc.).</p>

<p>Use the right compound for your goals, and always play it smart with support, bloodwork, and recovery.</p>
